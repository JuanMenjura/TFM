This project aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of fraud before selling insurance policies, utilizing advanced techniques such as XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. Despite implementing balancing methods like BorderlineSMOTE and ADASYN to address the extreme class imbalance, the results were insufficient for productive deployment, with performance metrics falling short of expectations. This work identified data limitations and potential methodological improvements, laying the groundwork for future research on fraud detection. Additionally, it highlighted the importance of data quality, experimentation with different approaches, and multidisciplinary collaboration to tackle complex problems in the insurance sector.
